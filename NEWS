# Releases

## Perceval 0.4 - (2016-11-03)

** New features and improvements: **

 * `category` field was added to items metadata to classify the type of
   the item generated with each backend.
 * The `tag` attribute added to the backends allows to mark the items
   with a custom label.
 * Two class methods, `has_caching` and `has_resuming`, are part now
   of `Backend` class interface to notify whether a backend supports
   caching and/or resuming of items.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **jenkins**
   - support blacklist of jobs
 * **mediawiki**
   - use API pages methods by default
 * **phabricator**
   - fetch and include projects data assigned to each task
 * **redmine**
   - fetch and include users data
 * **remo**
   - support new version of the API
 * **supybot**
   - parse messages written by special bots

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Filepaths on merge commits were not captured on Git backend. This was
   neccesary in those cases where merge commits only include data about
   lines added and removed because the filepaths were not parsed and
   included on the item data. (#63)
 * The `url` argument on the Gerrit backend was set to optional. It is
   mandatory. Thus, it was set to positional on the argument parser. (#60)
 * Newer versions of Phabricator fixed a bug on API Conduit regarding
   'constraints' parameter. The Phabricator client was modified to fix
   this bug, too. (#80)
 * Python's `requests` library decompresses gzip-encoded responses, but
   in some cases is only able to decompress some parts due to encoding
   issues or to mixed contents. This problem was fixed downloading and
   storing the orinal/raw data (compressed or decompressed) for furthed
   processing.
 * Jira backend did not return items in order, from oldest to newest. (#89)
 * Dates with invalid timezones were not parsed. In those cases, the
   the dates will be converted usin UTC by default. (#73)


## Perceval 0.3 - (2016-09-19)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Phabricator
    - Redmine
 * Add support for creating PyPi packages

** Backend improvements: **

 * **jira**
   - fetch additional information about custom fields
 * **mediawiki**
   - add a flag which ignores the MAX_RECENT_DAYS constraint when the
     backend is tested

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Cache tests for Redmine backend checked the values retrieved from the
   repository but not from the cache.
 * Timestamps generated to fetch data from a given date included invalid
   timezone information for Mediawiki API (>=1.27). It only works with Zulu
   dates. (#54)
 * Date strings that included information after the timezone were not parsed:
   `Thu, 14 Aug 2008 02:07:59 +0200 CEST`. (#57)


## Perceval 0.2 - (2016-07-20)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Bugzilla (REST API)
    - Confluence
    - Discourse
    - Gmane
    - Jenkins
    - Kitsune (Mozilla)
    - Mediawiki
    - Pipermail
    - ReMo (Mozilla)
    - Supybot
    - Telegram
 * The origin of the fetched data is configurable.
 * Unit tests for GitHub, Jira and Stack Exchange were added. Other tests
   were added and improved. Now, the unit tests framework covers a 83% of
   the source code.

** Backend improvements: **

 * **gerrit**
   - support server version 2.8
 * **git**
   - filtering by branches
   - so far, the full log was read before parsing it; now, it is parsed and processed
     while is being read
 * **github**
   - full control of GitHub API rate limit
   - the program can be sent to sleep until the rate limit is reset again
 * **mbox**
   - fetches messages since a given date
 * **pipermail**
   - fetches messages from a *mod_mbox* interface (i.e: Apache)

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Dates that included parentheses sections were not parsed:
   `2005 15:20:32 -0100 (GMT+1)`.
 * An encoding error was raised when `version.py` module was imported. (#32)
 * The call in chain of functions `utcnow()` and `timestamp()` from the
   module `time`, produced wrong timezones on the GitHub backend.
 * Action IRC messages (leading with a single `*`) were ignored. (#48)
 * The `backoff` field received in a Stack Exchange API response was
   ignored. When this field is set, any client must wait the number of
   seconds specified on it before sending any new request.
 * The query used in Gerrit to retrieve the reviews was badly formed when
   the blacklist filter contained two or more reviews. (#50)


## Perceval 0.1 - (2016-03-30)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Supports Python 3.4 and newer versions.
 * Fetches and caches information from several software repositories:
    - Bugzilla
    - Gerrit
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - Jira
    - MBox
    - Stack Exchange
 * Metadata fields are added to fetched items.
 * Dates and times used to request data are always converted to UTC.
 * Unit testing framework is available. Currently, these
   unit tests cover the 62% of the source code.

** Bugs fixed: **

 * Some Git commit log entries may not contain information about files.
   Before this was fixed, Perceval raised an exception with a "_Unexpected
   end of log stream_" message. (#8)
 * Empty Git commit logs raised erros when were parsed. (#17)
 * Character ^M) produced some parsing errors in the Git backend. (#21)
